This script harvests Open Data from portal.eks.sk (EKS) .

While EKS does publish some data as Open Data, data is accessible only after registering and logging in.

So, to simplify access to data to others, utilizing current laws of Slovak Rebublic, this script can be used to get the data for furtjer re-use, including further publication.
